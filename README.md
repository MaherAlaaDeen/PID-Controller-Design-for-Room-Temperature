# PID-Controller-Design-for-Room-Temperature
## Abstract
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to regulate the temperature of a room containing a heater. The system model incorporates the dynamics of heat transfer between the inside and outside environments, considering the effect of ambient temperature on the room's thermal stability. A simulation of the system is conducted using Simulink, where the PID controller is tuned to minimize the error between the desired user-defined temperature and the actual room temperature. The controller dynamically adjusts the heater's output to maintain the target temperature, compensating for fluctuations caused by external disturbances. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PID controller in achieving steady-state temperature control and minimizing temperature overshoot and settling time. This simulation provides a foundational framework for designing energy-efficient heating systems for residential and industrial applications.

2.	Model Heat Transfer Dynamics: Simulate the interaction between the indoor and outdoor temperatures and how external disturbances affect the room's thermal stability.
3.	Minimize Temperature Error: Achieve precise temperature control by reducing the error between the desired user-defined temperature and the actual temperature.
4.	Optimize Controller Performance: Tune the PID parameters to ensure stability, minimal overshoot, and reduced settling time for the system.
5.	Enhance Energy Efficiency: Evaluate the system's performance in maintaining the desired temperature while minimizing energy consumption.
6.	Develop a Scalable Framework: Provide a model that can be adapted to different heating systems and environments for both residential and industrial applications.
7.	Validate the Controller: Simulate the system using Simulink to assess the effectiveness of the PID controller under various operating conditions and disturbances.

## Background Theory
A thermal system is a physical system that involves the transfer, storage, and transformation of thermal energy (heat). It consists of components like solid bodies, fluids, or gases through which heat flows due to temperature differences. In thermal systems, the primary goal is often to manage temperature or energy distribution for heating, cooling, or maintaining equilibrium.
Heat can flow between Objects in three main mechanisms:
1.	Conduction: This is the transfer of heat through direct contact. In conduction, heat flows from the hotter part of an object to the cooler part via vibrations of atoms and free electrons. It is common in solids, especially metals, which have high thermal conductivity. For example, when you touch a metal spoon that’s in a hot pot, heat travels from the spoon’s end in the pot to the handle through conduction.
2.	Convection: This is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (liquid or gas). As the fluid near a heat source warms up, it becomes less dense and rises, while cooler, denser fluid moves down to take its place. This continuous cycle creates a convection current that transfers heat. Convection is common in fluids, such as the heating of water in a pot or the warming of air by a heater.
3.	Radiation: Heat transfer by radiation involves the emission of electromagnetic waves (infrared radiation) from a surface. This mechanism does not require a medium and can occur in a vacuum. For example, the Sun transfers heat to Earth through radiation across the vacuum of space. Surfaces with high emissivity, like black surfaces, radiate more heat than those with low emissivity, like shiny surfaces.

In a thermal system, these mechanisms often work together. For instance, in a home heating system, a radiator heats the air through conduction, and the warm air circulates via convection, while some heat is also radiated into the room.
